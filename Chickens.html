     <p>
        ‚ÄúInstead of playing to win, I was <br>playing not to lose. It reminds me<br> of the story I once heard<br> about two friends being chased by a bear,<br> when one turned to the other and said, <br>‚ÄòI just realized that I don‚Äôt need to<br> outrun the bear; I only need to outrun you.‚Äò‚Äù

    <p>The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
        species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally Rooster or cock is a term for an adult <a href="https://web.facebook.com/paul.adeyemo.5076/">Tosshue</a> 
        male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration">catrated</a> is a capon. An adult
        female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p> Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
        coours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the
        rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. inally raised for cockfighting

They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order',
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[36]
